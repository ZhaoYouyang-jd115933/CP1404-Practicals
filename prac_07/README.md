# CP1404 Practicals

Welcome to my CP1404 Practicals repository.  
This repo contains the practical exercises for the subject CP1404 - Programming II at JCU.  
It includes my code for weekly practicals, clean code principles, and programming patterns.

## About Me

My name is Zhao Youyang. I am a student at JCU studying IT.  
I am learning Python and practicing professional coding standards in this subject. I also want to improve my programming skills.
I am working on writing clean, easy-to-read, and well-organised code. I want my code to be simple to understand and easy to maintain.
This repository has all my practical work for the subject. It shows my progress and how I am learning to become a better programmer.  
I hope this will help me build good habits for writing professional code in the future.

## Lessons Learned About Clean Code

- **Meaningful Names**: Choose clear, descriptive variable and function names that explain what the program does.
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Break programs into small, focused functions and classes that each do one thing well.
- **Simplicity and clarity**: Writing code in small, focused functions with clear purposes, and adding docstrings for documentation.
