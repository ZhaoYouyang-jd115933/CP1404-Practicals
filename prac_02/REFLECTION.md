# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?
I have watched all the lecture videos within two weeks, so I have watched 20 percent of all the lecture videos within
10 weeks.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?
I finish my weekly practical as quickly as impossible, and then I watch lecture videos before next class.
Sometimes I watch lecture videos at school, sometimes I watch lecture videos in the dormitory.
I use the length of a video as a viewing standard. If I donâ€™t understand it after listening to it once, 
I will watch it again and then take a break for a few minutes before watching the next video.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
Before each class, I watch the lecture videos. I watch the lecture videos repeatedly until I 
understand the content of the videos.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
When I was writing a program that I thought was easy to write, I would think that the code I wrote was correct and 
not check it carefully, which leads that errors not being discovered or being discovered very late.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?
I start writing immediately after I read the question, and do not follow the steps to analyze the question first. 
I should analyze the question first to understand the meaning of the question.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?
After reading the problem, I will still write the algorithm first and then write the code according to the algorithm.
In addition, I will write program on paper first and use Pycharm to check my program.
