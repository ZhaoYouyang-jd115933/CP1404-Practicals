# Practical 06
# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

In the past, I didnâ€™t know where to start when I saw a question. Now I watch the video for several times 
and I can apply what I have learned to solve problems step by step.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to arrange my time for learning programming more evenly every day. I also need to avoid using PyCharm to 
write code as much as possible first. I also need to still review and remember what I have learned and the role of 
each code.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I actually write the code by hand first and then check it in PyCharm, but I still can't get the code all right the 
first time, so I need to continue to improve my ability in this area.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop procrastinating when I think a problem is hard instead of figuring out how to solve it. 
I also need to stop avoiding writing code without understanding it, which can lead to me not knowing where to start. 
I need to really understand the problem first.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I think this subject can add more questions to the online tests and practicals, and add more types of questions that 
will be in the final exams for us to practice.
